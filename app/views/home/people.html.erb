                        <p>Patty and I met through my old roommate, Marcia, when she decided to leave.  Since then, I think of Patty as my adopted sister, someone I can talk to about everything and rely on. Patty has been very supportive in helping to plan the wedding -- at times more excited about wedding planning than I was :)</p>

                        <p>Fate matched Kristine and I together when I decided to become an intern social coordinator.  We clicked immediately from our energy to love in cooking and crafts.  We are as they say -- two peas in a pod, especially when it comes to planning a wedding. </p>

Even though we had a short journey of 4 months living together, Marcia is the best roommate that I have ever had. We made quite a pair.</p>

                        <p>Kiersten has been a very close friend since high school.  Our relationship started off in London, when we had to share a room together.  When we walked into the hotel room, one bed was a queen and the other was a cot.  Kiersten offered to take the cot, but I felt bad so I said we should put the two beds together.  From there, it's history.</p>

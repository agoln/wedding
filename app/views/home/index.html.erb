    <h2>our story</h2>
    <p>Logan and Janis rock. We totally make a cute couple. We know you love us. But seriously - they met during Janis' first summer internship at Microsoft and Logan just started full time.  They met through their admin, Sara, who was secretly trying to match them together from the start.  They started hanging out the summer of 2008 until Janis started working full time at Microsoft in May 2010.  They have been dating since May 2010. Yup. Logan asked her out as soon as she began a full time employee at Microsoft.</p>
    <p>From there it's history.</p>

    <h2>the proposal</h2>    
    <p>Janis and Logan went on a month long adventure to pick up Logan's new BMW and go on a whirlwind adventure around Europe.  Of the locations, they decided to stop by Paris, the city of love.  After a walk through Paris, Logan proposed in a secluded area by Notre Dame and she said yes.  The best part is that he hired a photographer beforehand, so you can see the footage of the action.</p>
